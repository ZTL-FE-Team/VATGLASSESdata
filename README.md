# Guide for contributing 

First off, before you even start pushing stuff, please read https://github.com/lennycolton/vatglasses-data/wiki as this will give you an overview of everything that is needed, also look at other ARTCCs data folders to get an understanding of the file structure.
Once you have read the wiki, you are free to push/add stuff as needed. You will NOT need to add anything required by the web team, as that is their problem, not ours.
